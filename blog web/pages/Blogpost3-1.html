            <p>Do you want to learn how to code a website? Behind the scenes, most website code contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                As a beginner, learning these programming languages (even at a beginner level) requires hours of studying and practice.
                
                The good news for business owners is that there are excellent tools that let you create any type of website (without writing code).
                
                In this comprehensive guide, we’ll cover how to code a website by using drag and drop tools that create all the code for you.
                
                For those who want to code a website from scratch, we will share how to learn the code fundamentals, so you can do just that.</p>
            <p>WordPress is the most popular website builder platform because it powers over 40% of all websites on the internet.

                It comes with multiple tools that let you create a custom website from scratch without learning how to code.</p>
            <p>If you’re a student and want to learn how to code a website from scratch, then you’ll need to understand the web development fundamentals like HTML5, CSS3, and more.
                
                While there are many free and paid courses out there, the best one that we have found is the one on Code Academy.
                
                It takes roughly 9 hours to complete, but by the end of it, you would have learned to code a custom responsive website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
                
                Even after you’re done with the course, you’ll need hours of practice before you can truly become efficient at coding websites from scratch.
                
                We hope this article helped you learn how to code a website. You may also want to see our guide on how to increase website traffic and best tools for freelancers, designers, and developers. </p>
