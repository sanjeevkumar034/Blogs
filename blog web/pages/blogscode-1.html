            <p>In computer programming, computer code refers to the set of instructions, or a system of rules, written in a particular programming language (i.e., the source code).

                It is also the term used for the source code after it has been processed by a compiler and made ready to run on the computer (i.e., the object code).
                
                In addition to building computer programs and mobile applications, code is used heavily for innovative concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Of course, there are several other uses and applications for the word code, explained in the next section.
                
                .</p>
            <p>As stated previously, in computer science, code refers to the computer program algorithms, made up of symbols from a source alphabet, that represent the set of rules on what actions the program is expected to perform.

                Essentially, it is our human language, translated by a coder, into lines of code that a computer can understand and respond to. It allows programmers to create software programs, operating systems and mobile applications.
                
                Within computer language, specifically, there are a number of ways in which machine code can be used to provoke action or facilitate functionality..</p>
            <p>When writing code, there are a number of different coding languages in use today and each has different benefits and applications they are most commonly used for, such as:

                PHP. PHP is a general scripting language used heavily in web development.
                Java. Java is an object-oriented programming language built to have minimal dependencies for implementation and requires compilation. It is heavily used in back-end software
                JavaScript. JavaScript is an all-text programming language that, unlike Java, can be run on a browser only.
                Python. Python is another general-purpose programming language designed to emphasize readability. </p>
