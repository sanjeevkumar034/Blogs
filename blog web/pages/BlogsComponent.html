            <h3>What is Code</h3>
            <h5>May 3, 2022</h5>
            <p class="blog-content-description">In computer programming, computer code refers to the set of instructions, or a system of rules, written in a particular programming language (i.e., the source code).

                It is also the term used for the source code after it has been processed by a compiler and made ready to run on the computer (i.e., the object code).
                
                In addition to building computer programs and mobile applications, code is used heavily for innovative concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Of course, there are several other uses and applications for the word code, explained in the next section <a href="./blogscode-1.html">Read More</a></p>
